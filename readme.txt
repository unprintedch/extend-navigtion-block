Extend the core navigation block with dynamic offcanvas functionality, customizable animations, and dynamic width/height.

== Description ==

The Dc24 Extend Navigation Block plugin enhances the default WordPress core navigation block by adding dynamic offcanvas menu functionality. It allows the navigation to smoothly slide in from any direction (left, right, up, or down), with fully customizable transition speeds and easing.

In addition, this plugin introduces dynamic width and height settings for horizontal and vertical transitions, making the menu's dimensions adjustable depending on your design needs. You can manage these settings via CSS variables or adjust them dynamically with JavaScript, allowing you to build flexible, responsive navigation systems.

### Features:
- Offcanvas navigation that slides from any direction (left, right, up, or down)
- Customizable transition speeds and easing
- Dynamic width for horizontal movements and height for vertical movements
- Fully responsive design, with support for different screen sizes
- Accessible, with focus management and proper aria attributes

To install the plugin:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/dc24-extend-navigation-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
